# Medical Data Analysis: Feasibility Solutions Tutoring Study Guide

This study guide is a summary of the key takeaways from a discussion between Tony, an engineer, and Paul, a physician. They discuss the intersection of healthcare and technology, focusing on medical data analysis and the development of feasible solutions.

## Key Takeaways

- Tony and Paul kicked off their discussion acknowledging the importance of medical data analysis. They agreed on exploring this field together, with Tony leaning towards a casual teaching style.

- They delved into the development of a plugin for Electronic Health Records (EHR) that could summarize patient data and provide alerts. They stressed the need for a standardized coding language in EHRs to ensure better interoperability between different systems.

- The conversation then moved to the use of synthetic patient data in JSON format for machine learning in healthcare. They discussed the potential of training a machine to sort and analyze the data to identify patterns and predict patient care needs.

- Tony and Paul emphasized the need for improved communication and interoperability in healthcare systems, particularly regarding EHRs. They explored the idea of parsing JSON files to categorize and extract relevant information, aiming to design a system that can reduce the burden on physicians and improve patient care.

- The duo underlined the significance of drafting technical requirements and specifications prior to the software development process. They discussed the role of a back-end developer and shared resources like career roadmaps on GitHub.

- The discussion concluded with Tony and Paul detailing the project's specifications and requirements. Tony provided guidance on what needs to be communicated to the developers, and it was agreed that Paul would review the roadmap provided by Tony to understand the skills required for the project better.
